# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Tarang Chikhalia, a passionate Software Engineer and lifelong learner based in Ottawa, Canada.

I'm currently focused on:

- Designing smarter systems using ML/AI
- Implementing the latest Generative AI technologies
- Integrating AI/LLMs into personal workflows
- Exploring new ways to solve problems using assisted AI

Beyond the screen, Iâ€™m an avid hiker, camper, and stargazer ðŸŒŒ. I find deep meaning in conversations about Cosmology, and the bigger picture of life.
